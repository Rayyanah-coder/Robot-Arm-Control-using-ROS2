1. Controlling the robot arm by joint_state_publisher
What it is:
This method simulates or publishes joint positions of the robot.

How it works:
You manually change joint angles using a GUI or YAML configuration.

Purpose:
Mostly for visualization and testing in simulation tools like RViz.

Limitation:
It doesn't involve real motion planning or physics. It’s static and ideal for setting joint values manually.

2. Controlling the robot arm by MoveIt and kinematics
What it is:
This is a motion planning framework.

How it works:
You set a target pose (e.g. where the robot’s end-effector should go), and MoveIt calculates the joint angles automatically using inverse kinematics and path planning algorithms.

Purpose:
Used in real or complex simulation environments to plan and execute movements dynamically.

Powerful for:
Collision avoidance, trajectory planning, and more intelligent arm control.
